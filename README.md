# Microhaplotypes-paper
Script created to generate MH from vcf files. The script was used as describeb in the paper.
There are two types of vcf files: 1) SNPs_in_MH_vcfs presents a list of all SNPs position included in some MH (repeated IDs mean a MH); 2) MHs_vcfs includes a list of MHs and their respective alleles (haplotypes) formed by MH_script after phashing.
If you use our data or our script in full or even adapted, please cite us.
